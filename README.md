# Exploratory Database Querying in SQL

In this project, I use SQL to run some simple queries on a sample database provided by Microsoft: The AdventureWorks Sample Database. The database is a collection of simple  tables of synthetic data about a bike parts manufacturer arranged with a simple schema. It can be hosted on a cloud server and accessed with an online database driver to practice SQL queries which is what I do in this project.

Let's have a look at this data!

## Implementation Background Info

This is a self-guided project that I planned, initiated, and performed original analysis for purely as a personal interest project. When looking for simple ways to practice SQL, I learned that Microsoft allows Azure users a [free trial of its Azure SQL Database service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/free-offer?view=azuresql) in which they can host a few databases for free. Not only do they provide this, they also have a sample database that users can host on their servers to test both database querying and application production among other things.

Check out the notebook to see my analysis!
