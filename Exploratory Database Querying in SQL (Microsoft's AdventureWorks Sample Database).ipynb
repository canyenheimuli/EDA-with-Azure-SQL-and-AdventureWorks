    "# Exploratory Database Querying in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I use SQL to run some simple queries on a sample database provided by Microsoft: The AdventureWorks Sample Database. The database is a collection of simple  tables of synthetic data about a bike parts manufacturer arranged with a simple schema. It can be hosted on a cloud server and accessed with an online database driver to practice SQL queries which is what I do in this project.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a self-guided project that I planned, initiated, and performed original analysis for purely as a personal interest project. When looking for simple ways to practice SQL, I learned that Microsoft allows Azure users a [free trial of its Azure SQL Database service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/free-offer?view=azuresql) in which they can host a few databases for free. Not only do they provide this, they also have a sample database that users can host on their servers to test both database querying and application production among other things. I created a server on which I host a copy of this free database and connected to it remotely using the `pyodbc` package as shown in the first few code cells below:"

I found that this company, far and away, makes the bulk of its money selling actual bikes, as opposed to clothes or bike accessories. I also identified its top 10 clients in terms of sales revenue. These would be valuable insights to this company, both in helping it evaluate its performance and plan for future business strategies."
